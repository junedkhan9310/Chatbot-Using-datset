# Chatbot Project README

## Overview

This project aims to develop a chatbot using a dataset that will be trained through tokenization of words and searching through the data. The primary components of the project include tokenization, lemmatization, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create a conversational interface.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `nltk`

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy nltk
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd <project_directory>
```

3. Run the main script to initiate the chatbot.

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

## Implementation Details

### Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking down text into smaller units, such as words or sentences. In this project, tokenization is utilized to extract meaningful tokens from the input text.

### Lemmatization

Lemmatization is the process of reducing words to their base or root form. This helps in standardizing words and improving the accuracy of language processing tasks. The NLTK library's WordNetLemmatizer is employed for lemmatization in this project.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP techniques are applied to understand and interpret human language. The chatbot utilizes NLP methods to analyze user input, generate responses, and maintain a meaningful conversation.
